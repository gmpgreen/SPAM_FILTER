# SPAM_FILTER
ECE 470 Project

## Installation

- Since the SMS dataset is small, it is including in its entirely in the repo.

## Problem Statement and Motivation

The motivation for this project is to develop a system that can filter
out spam messages sent over SMS. The spam filter will be targeted
towards unwanted marketing or phishing messages. To help select relevant
features to train the model, a genetic algorithm will be used with
feature extraction to find the optimal set of features used for
filtering messages. Feature extraction is one of the more difficult
steps in machine learning, but is essential to having accurate and
reliable machine learning models. Using genetic algorithms the optimal
features can be extracted from the entire feature set. Some
disadvantages of genetic algorithms are computationally expensive and
algorithms takes a long time to converge.


## Programming Language

The programming languages used in this project will be C++ and Python.
Libraries for parsing text, text files, and mathematical functions will
be added as necessary with a preference to use standard libraries
whenever possible.
